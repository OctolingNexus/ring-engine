# Welcome
After all these years of work I've decided to create a repository showing all of my work. The project is not finished but I'll continue to update until we have a clean and good version of the Ring Engine.

# Source Code
Here we have a lots of types of source code, begginer codes, intermediate codes and advanced codes. Remember, this project teach me how to program in C#. Code will be optimized with time for better reading and performance. The source code in here is fully open source, there some third part codes too, but remember I've spend many years on this! When you share, remember to credit me or the respective owner.
# Finally
I hope everyone who reached to this repository like the content and have fun using Ring Engine.
